    "Customers are not all the same.  If we can figure out what _classes_ of customers we have, we may be able to better meet their needs. \n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Segmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "* segmentation involves dividing the market (your prospects and customers) into homogenous subgroups\n",
    "* using these segments we can drive other business activities:\n",
    "  * different, targeted marketing campaigns\n",
    "  * unique pricing strategies and price points.  (Understanding basic economics/econometrics can help you here)\n",
    "\n",
    "## How do we do Segmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "3 basic methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **_a priori_ segmentation**\n",
    "  * we know the segments ahead of time.  Based on experience and history we know how we want to classify our customers.  \n",
    "  * example:  electric utilities divide their market into residential, commercial, and industry segments\n",
    "* **supervised (machine) learning** -- a model-based approach\n",
    "  * we know what _features_ we want to use as part of the segmentation and the _label_ is the segments\n",
    "  * we have to have _labeled_ historical segmentation data already\n",
    "  * When is this useful?  If we know the segments for existing customers but we want to classify new customers.  \n",
    "* **unsupervised learning** -- clustering \n",
    "  * when we don't know the segments _a priori_ but want the machine to teach us interesting things about our data.  \n",
    "  * this is a great way to facilitate _Design Thinking_ about our customers.  \n",
    "  * Examples\n",
    "    * hierarchical clustering \n",
    "      * agglomerative:  all rows start as their own cluster and the hierarchy is built bottom-up.  More compute-efficient.\n",
    "      * divisive:  all rows start in one big initial cluster (the root) and then we pull apart the differences (top-down approach).  More compute-intensive.    \n",
    "    * k-means clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's do some clustering using a real world use case\n",
    "\n",
    "## Case Study\n",

    "* midwest\n",
    "* northeast\n",
    "* south\n",
